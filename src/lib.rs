//! `rsevents` is an implementation of WIN32's auto- and manual-reset events for the rust world.
//! Events are synchronization primitives (i.e. not implemented atop of mutexes) used to either
//! create other synchronization primitives with or for implementing signalling between threads.
//!
//! Events come in two different flavors: [`AutoResetEvent`] and [`ManualResetEvent`]. Internally,
//! both are implemented with the unsafe `RawEvent` and use the `parking_lot_core` crate to take
//! care of efficiently suspending (parking) threads while they wait for an event to become
//! signalled.
//!
//! An event is a synchronization primitive that is functionally the equivalent of an (optionally
//! gated) waitable boolean that allows for synchronization between threads. Unlike mutexes and
//! condition variables which are most often used to restrict access to a critical section, events
//! are more appropriate for efficiently signalling remote threads or waiting on a remote thread to
//! change state.
